# InstaCartAnalysis-Python
Acting as an analyst for Instacart, I'm diving into their sales data to uncover hidden patterns.I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Instacart. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

## Context
Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales.

## Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

  1. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

  2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

  3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

  4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

  5. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

  6. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are 
         ordering, and anything else you can think of.
